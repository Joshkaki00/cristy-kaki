        <h1>About Cristy Kaki</h1>
        <p>Holding an A.A. degree in Art, an A.S. degree in Art, and a B.A. degree in Clinical Psychology with a focus on art therapy, Cristy Kaki has been featured in books about artists in the Philippines and Canada. She grew up surrounded by various designs and patterns of shoes and slippers, as it is her family’s business. She began designing and making shoes at an early age while also learning to sing and perform cultural dances at school. This personal history gives an unusual and unique character of whimsy, innocence, and a forever striving spirit to her work.</p>
        <p>Her vision for art is to create calm, a sense of freedom, and connection through painting or sculpting, whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. She believes that the impact of art lies in building confidence, creative flexibility, and skillful thinking, considering all of these a gift. Unlike other artists, she keeps in mind the therapeutic and creative aspects of art in her process and approach to painting and sculpting. Whether painting on canvas or sculpting with plaster, she allows the substance of her materials to reveal the intrinsic traits of the nature she represents.</p>
        <p>Working with acrylics, oil, and gouache for her paintings, as well as plaster, wood, and small metals for her sculptures, she promotes a fluid style that presents her artwork with a proximity that captures the essence of nature while exploring an inner visual existence. The artist aims for her art to communicate with the viewer by being absorbing, collectible, deeply thoughtful, and visually stimulating.</p>
